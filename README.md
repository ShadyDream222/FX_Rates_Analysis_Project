# FX_Rates_Analysis_Project

**Contributeur** : GUIDDIR Lucas 

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze foreign exchange (FX) rates and their potential correlation with macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

```
├── GUIDDIR_FX_Project.ipynb     # Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations
├── requirements.txt             # Lists all dependencies required to run the project
├── unemployement rate.xlsx      # Excel file with unemployment rate data for analysis
├── README.md                    # Documentation
```

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd FX_Rates_Analysis_Project-main
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook GUIDDIR_FX_Project.ipynb
```

## Analysis Summary
The project includes:

- Importing and preprocessing FX rate data
- Analyzing unemployment rate trends
- Identifying correlations between macroeconomic factors and FX movements
- Data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more economic indicators (GDP, inflation, interest rates)
- Building predictive models for FX rate forecasting
- Expanding the dataset with more historical data
